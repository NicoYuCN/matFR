%Input arguments are X a training matrix of training data for the model
% (lines = features, columns = observations). Y is a vector with the training
% outputs of classess or continous values.
%Outputs are "forest_temp" a structure that is a cell array with each cell 
%having an individual tree, and "feature_imp", a vector with the importance
%of each feature expressed in percentage.
