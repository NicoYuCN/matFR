# This is an example of how to use the Feature-Ranking Self-Growing Forest
# algorithm (FSF) for classification tasks.

# A neural networks approach to residuary resistance of sailing yachts prediction.
# In Proceedings of the International Conference on Marine Engineering MARINE 2007, 2007.
# The output is the residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement.

# An histogram with the most important features used for prediction
# according to the FSF criteria is plotted. This will change every time the

# of each predictor according to the FSF criteria. This vector will always
# sum 100, since importance is expresed in percentages.
