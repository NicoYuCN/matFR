# Feature-Ranking-Self-Growing-Forest
A tree ensemble algorithm that automatically grows decision trees based on the trees' structure diversity. The tree ensemble is optimized for performance and low computational cost. Can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Functions and a script example are programmed in MATLAB. A class is implemented for Python. 
For using the code with MATLAB the files "FSF.mat", "FSF_tree", "FSF_rand_split" and "FSF_prediction" need to be downloaded and placed in the same folder where the intended script will be run.  An example of how to use FSF for classification and regression is provided in the script "FSF_Example_classification_and_regression.mat". The script must be placed in the same folder as the other MATLAB functions of FSF. 
An implementation in Python of FSF is also available, as also is an example for classification and regression. To run the example of FSF in Python, the file "FSF.py" must be downloaded, as well as, the example for classification "DemoforClassification.py" and the example for regression "DemoForRegression.py" files. FSF is a class that can be used to create the ensemble and perform predictions with it in Python.
A complete description of FSF and its validation is currently under review in a scientific journal, and the article's link will be shared as soon as it is published.
